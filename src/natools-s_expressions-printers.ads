-- Natools.S_Expressions.Printers mainly provides an interface for objects  --
-- that are "printer-like", which means the client somehow transmits        --
-- sequentially whatever information is needed to output a S-expression.    --
-- This contrasts with Descriptor interface, in that the latter provides an --
-- interface for S-expression from the object to its client, while Printer  --
-- interface is for S-epression transmitted from the client to its the      --
-- object.                                                                  --

-- The package also provide concrete type Canonical, which outputs the      --
-- S-expression provided through the interface into the given output        --
-- stream, using canonical encoding.                                        --

-- Natools.Tests is an abstract interface for objects holding the results   --

-- Each test can have one of the following results:                         --
--   * Success, when everything goes well,                                  --
--   * Fail, when the test itself went fine the but the result is wrong,    --
--   * Error, when the test itself went wrong, which does not tell whether  --
--     the tested thing is fine or not,                                     --
--   * Skipped, when for any reason the test has not been performed         --
